        <div class="about-text">
            Hello, I am Xiaosu Lyu, a PhD student in Computer Science at The George Washington University. My research focuses on distributed systems, edge computing, and cloud computing. I enjoy building low-level, system-oriented solutions. During my PhD, I have designed and implemented serverless platforms using WebAssembly, kernel-bypass networking, and customized user-level scheduling to achieve strong isolation, high performance, 
            and resource efficiency in both edge and data center environments.

            Research can be challenging, but it is also incredibly rewarding. I enjoy tackling tough problems with a scientific approach and witnessing my growth day by day, year by year.

            Before starting my PhD, I worked as a software engineer for several years, primarily focusing on backend servers, including CDN, live streaming, and networking-related systems. I am always curious about computer technology and strive to understand and explain every system using my own knowledge. When my knowledge falls short, I enjoy diving deep, layer by layer, until everything makes sense. This curiosity and persistence are what motivated me to pursue a PhD—to become a better engineer in general and an expert in my area of focus.

            I am currently looking for job opportunities where I can apply my expertise and continue learning in distributed systems and cloud/edge computing.
