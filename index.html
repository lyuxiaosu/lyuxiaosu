        <div class="about-text">
            Hello, I am Xiaosu Lyu, a PhD student in Computer Science at The George Washington University, advised by Professor <a href="https://engineering.gwu.edu/timothy-wood" class="advisor-link" target="_blank">Timothy Wood</a>. My research focuses on distributed systems, edge computing, and cloud computing. I am interested in low-level systems research, including operating systems, runtimes, virtualization, memory management, networking and infrastructure. During my PhD, I have designed and implemented serverless platforms using WebAssembly, kernel-bypass networking (DPDK, RDMA), and customized user-level scheduling to achieve strong isolation, high performance, and resource efficiency in both edge and data center environments.

            Research can be challenging, but it is also incredibly rewarding. I enjoy tackling difficult problems with a scientific approach and growing through the process.

            Before starting my PhD, I worked as a software engineer for several years, primarily focusing on backend servers, including CDN, live streaming, and networking-related work. I am always curious about computer technology and strive to understand and explain every technology and system using my own knowledge. When my knowledge falls short, I enjoy diving deep, layer by layer, until everything makes sense. This curiosity and persistence are what motivated me to pursue a PhD—to become a better engineer in general and an expert in my area of focus.

            I am currently seeking opportunities in distributed systems and cloud/edge computing, and would be happy to connect with teams interested in my background.
